            <h3>CHAMPION</h3>
                The <span>C</span> is for the courage I possess through the drama
<span>H</span> is for the hurt but it's all for the honor
<span>A</span> is for my attitude working through the patience
Money comes and goes so the <span>M</span> is for motivation
Gotta stay consistent, the <span>P</span> is to persevere
The <span>I</span> is for integrity, innovative career
The <span>O</span> is optimistic, open and never shut
And the <span>N</span> is necessary 'cause I'm never giving up
See they ask me how I did it, I just did it from the heart
Crushing the competition, been doing it from the start
They say that every champion is all about his principles
